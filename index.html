<!-- All Code Written by Jonathan de Laine. Copright 2021
Thanks for checking out my webpage!
 I decided to code my own webpage for several reasons:
    1. I enjoy coding. Pure and simple!
    2. I struggle with creativity in the traditional sense.
        By using technology and TYPING what I want, I can more effectively
        create the vision I have in my mind instead of following and modifying templates
|   3. I am one to rise to a challenge. Prior to this website I had no experience in HTML, CSS or JS.
    4. No ads on my webpage. By analyzing code found in Wix templates (popular website builder) 
        I found that Wix has inserted a plethora of POTENTIAL ads to be displayed on pages 
        made using their software. This left a sour taste in my mouth as
        I want this page to be about MY work. 
    5. How cool is it to have something you've created on display?!-->

                                Utilizing Message Query Telemtery Transport (MQTT) connectivity and an ESP32 microcontroller, this cat feeder was designed to 
                                allow the user to remotely dispense food and check food level remaining in a cat food bowl. This project was created as a final project
                                for my "Internet of Things" course at UC Berkeley. See the video below to see the product in action!

                                This project was the final portion of my "Electronics for the Internet of Things (IOT)" course at UC Berkeley for the Fall 2019 Semester.
                                The goal of the project was to combine what you had learned in the class to create an exciting IoT application which we were to build, and demonstrate as a group.
                                The project had to meet four (4) functionality criteria:

                                    <li>Actuation - acting on the environment with motors, switches, light, sound, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Computing - Using data gathered from sensors to control actuation and send and get data from the cloud.</li>

                                    To handle the communication criteria of the project, I chose to use the popular messaging app Telegram. 
                                    I chose Telegram as the platform as native support for "Telegram Bots" which survey the Telegram API and execute actions based on input.
                                    A Telegram bot was set up to interact with the user and give notifcations when food was dispensed or to notify the user of food level in the bowl.<br>
                                    As both the ESP32 and the Bot were subscribed to the same messaging app, we were able to communicate wirelessly to our ESP32 to issue commands, acting as an MQTT. <br>
    
                                    <br>
                                    All code was written in the Arduino environment. A special library "UniversalTelegramBot.h" was utilized to connect the ESP32 to Telegram. <br>

                                    Prototypes for the structure of the project and STL files used for 3D printing were all produced in SOLIDWORKS.

                                The final grade received on this project was a 95/100 resulting in a solid A. 5 points were deducted due to a jam of "cat food" 
                                during the final demonstration of our project.<br>

                                This project helped to solidify some of the shortcomings of additive manufacturing. The shaft used to attach our 3D Printed
                                impeller faced large cantilevered forces that were not adequately handled and thus eventually led to failure of the part.<br>

                                In the future, a bearing will be used to held support the impeller's shaft and prevent excessive stress on the part.

                                    I took charge of designing the turbine blade sketch profiles. <br>
                                    Using scientific journal articles I discovered that the most effective airfoil pattern used in wind turbines was the 
                                    NACA 4412 airfoil. Using an Excel sheet, I scaled the profile to follow a logarithmic change in cross-section area along the blade as recommended by several academic papers.<br>

                                    The tower used followed closely the design our group created in sketches at the beginning of the assignment. We took
                                    inspiration from classical trussed structures such as a farm windmill to produce a strong foundation with minimal material.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Slight modification of the models shown to the left were made to remove the necessity of support material. This change involved printing a single face 4 times to glue together in final assembly. <br>

                                    Our tower ended up with a deflection of 1.02mm of deflection under a 1kg lateral loading. Due to the low volume of our tower, this result meant that we received a bonus 5% points
                                    to our final score as our tower had the highest stiffness to weight ratio.
