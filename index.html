<!-- All Code Written by Jonathan de Laine. Copright 2021
Thanks for checking out my webpage!
 I decided to code my own webpage for several reasons:
    1. I enjoy coding. Pure and simple!
    2. I struggle with creativity in the traditional sense.
        By using technology and TYPING what I want, I can more effectively
        create the vision I have in my mind instead of following and modifying templates
|   3. I am one to rise to a challenge. Prior to this website I had no experience in HTML, CSS or JS.
    4. No ads on my webpage. By analyzing code found in Wix templates (popular website builder) 
        I found that Wix has inserted a plethora of POTENTIAL ads to be displayed on pages 
        made using their software. This left a sour taste in my mouth as
        I want this page to be about MY work. 
    5. How cool is it to have something you've created on display?!-->

                        Welcome!<br> This page was created for two purposes: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To serve as a portoflio to market my talents</li>

                    <p>
                        I created this website from scratch in Visual Studio so all functionality, design choices (or lack thereof!), and code written is my own. Feel free to right click anywhere on the page and select "inspect element" if you're curious! <br>
                        Please bear in mind that this project is continually adapting as I get more familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <br>

                                Utilizing Message Query Telemtery Transport (MQTT) connectivity and an ESP32 microcontroller, this cat feeder was designed to 
                                allow the user to remotely dispense food and check food level remaining in a cat food bowl. This project was created as a final project
                                for my "Internet of Things" course at UC Berkeley. See the video below to see the product in action!

                                This project was the final portion of my "Electronics for the Internet of Things (IOT)" course at UC Berkeley for the Fall 2019 Semester.
                                The goal of the project was to combine what you had learned in the class to create an exciting IoT application which we were to build, and demonstrate as a group.
                                The project had to meet four (4) functionality criteria:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Sensing - acquire information from the "real world" such as environmental parameters, motion, location, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Actuation - acting on the environment with motors, switches, light, sound, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Computing - Using data gathered from sensors to control actuation and send and get data from the cloud.</li>
                                    <li>Communication - Communicate wirelessly</li>

                                    To handle the communication criteria of the project, I chose to use the popular messaging app Telegram. 
                                    I chose Telegram as the platform as native support for "Telegram Bots" which survey the Telegram API and execute actions based on input.
                                    A Telegram bot was set up to interact with the user and give notifcations when food was dispensed or to notify the user of food level in the bowl.<br>
                                    As both the ESP32 and the Bot were subscribed to the same messaging app, we were able to communicate wirelessly to our ESP32 to issue commands, acting as an MQTT. <br>
    
                                    <br>
                                    All code was written in the Arduino environment. A special library "UniversalTelegramBot.h" was utilized to connect the ESP32 to Telegram. <br>

                                    Prototypes for the structure of the project and STL files used for 3D printing were all produced in SOLIDWORKS.

                                The final grade received on this project was a 95/100 resulting in a solid A. 5 points were deducted due to a jam of "cat food" 
                                during the final demonstration of our project.<br>

                                This project helped to solidify some of the shortcomings of additive manufacturing. The shaft used to attach our 3D Printed
                                impeller faced large cantilevered forces that were not adequately handled and thus eventually led to failure of the part.<br>

                                In the future, a bearing will be used to held support the impeller's shaft and prevent excessive stress on the part.

                                    I took charge of designing the turbine blade sketch profiles. <br>
                                    Using scientific journal articles I discovered that the most effective airfoil pattern used in wind turbines was the 
                                    NACA 4412 airfoil. Using an Excel sheet, I scaled the profile to follow a logarithmic change in cross-section area along the blade as recommended by several academic papers.<br>

                                    The tower used followed closely the design our group created in sketches at the beginning of the assignment. We took
                                    inspiration from classical trussed structures such as a farm windmill to produce a strong foundation with minimal material.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Slight modification of the models shown to the left were made to remove the necessity of support material. This change involved printing a single face 4 times to glue together in final assembly. <br>

                                    Our tower ended up with a deflection of 1.02mm of deflection under a 1kg lateral loading. Due to the low volume of our tower, this result meant that we received a bonus 5% points
                                    to our final score as our tower had the highest stiffness to weight ratio.

                                    This project was the final portion of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum under COVID-19 style restrictions. 
                                    All UC Berkeley Mechanical Engineering students must take "Mechatronics Design" - a capstone course wherein the knowledge gained over the entire undergraduate curriculum is intended to 
                                    be used. Under COVID restrictions, this course's typical semester-long project was condensed into a "mini-project" to be more equitable to students without machine shop access at home. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    As a big-time electronic music fan, I wanted to take this opportunity to make a "wow!" inspiring light show.

                                <p>
                                    For this project I chose to follow the first or two prompts given to us: "Rough Physical Prototype at Home" <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For this prompt I was asked to create a product for my own use that could be for learning and entertainment or a useful widget.<br>
                                    This prompt had two specific requirements:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>A Mechanical Part (e.g., housing and/or mechanisms)</li>
                                        <li>A circuit with sensors and actuators</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <br>
                                    To achieve this, I designed and 3D printed a housing to satisfy the mechanical portion and included an ESP32, a MOSFET and LED strip to serve as an actuator, and a microphone and temperature sensor to act as sensors. 
                                    Additionally, I also included a cooling fan as another actuator.

                                    <br> Below is the full writeup for the project, containing all details of the project including photos, a circuit diagram, finite state machine diagram, descriptions, and all code written.

                                One of the more light-hearted and well received projects I have been a part of. This project was an end-of-semester showcase project
                                with the prompt "adding an extra functionality to an iPhone." This special iPhone case has an integrated squirt gun functionality with easily removable water tank for refilling.
                                Under this project I was the head CAD modeling designer responsible for designing the iPhone case, water tanks, and sliding-to-snap fit mechanism for the tank.

                                    The natural first step for the design of this project was to construct a CAD model of an iPhone X case.
                                    Shown to the left is the engineering drawing for the final product that became the foundation for the remaining more difficult portions of the project.
                                    The drawing seen results from a combination of digital calipers to measure my iPhone, Apple's online documentation, and trial-and-error. The variance between 3D prints
                                    meant that this portion of the project was particularly tricky and required many prints.
                                </p>

                                    The image on the left highlights the difficulty in producing tight fits using 3D printed technology.
                                    Although all cases on a macro scale appear similar, millimeter changes to important dimensions like width, height, fillet radius,
                                    chamfers, and modifications to the "arms" holding to the front of the phone were made until adequate fit was achieved.

                                    Of particular importance to this project was what I called the "calculator cover" fit between the refillable water
                                    tank and the case. This part of the project was by far the most challenging part of this project. With 3D printed tolerances,
                                    many iterations were required to produce both a case and tank that would allow for this motion to function as intended.

                                <p>
                                    As I wanted to reproduce the motion seen in my graphing calculator, I spent a significant amount of time measuring and inspecting
                                    the rails from my calculator cover. By reproducing this design I could implement it onto the back of the case where
                                    the tank was expected to fit.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="casedesignimg">

                                <p>
                                    After the rails were designed, I moved to designing the water tank. Initially printed as a hollow container, I later changed the design to
                                    have a separately printed lid such that the 3D printer would not need any support material.
                                    As this part would need to interface with the rails on the case, I used SOLIDWORKS' mold function and imprinted the negative of the rails
                                    into the sides of the tank.
                                </p>

                                    This portion was quick and just required joining bodies in SOLIDWORKS.

                                    A majority of my time spent on this project was spent making millimeter-scale changes to the width of the tank design
                                    to produce the desired behavior. As the timeline progressed, this part of the project became increasingly stressful
                                    as the deadline approached. As each print took several hours (3+) to complete, I was frustratingly reminded of the limitations
                                    of additive manufacturing in its present state.
